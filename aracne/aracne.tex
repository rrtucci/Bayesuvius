\chapter{ARACNE-structure learning}
\label{ch-aracne}

This chapter
is based on
Ref.\cite{aracne}.

The ARACNE algo
is an algo for learning the structure
of a bnet from data.
The algo
considers data samples
for $n$ random variables
$(x_i)_{i=0, 1, \dots, n-1}$,
and estimates the mutual
information $MI_{i,j}=H(\rvx_i:\rvx_j)$ between
every pair of nodes.
The set $UG$ is initialized to
contain all the edges of a fully connected
undirected graph.
Next the algo
removes from $UG$
every edge with $MI_{i,j}<\eps$
for some threshold $0<\eps<<1$.
Then the algo examines every
triplet of edges
in $UG$, and marks for removal 
the edge of the triplet
with the smallest MI.
Finally,
the algo removes from $UG$  all
edges marked for removal.
 Each triplet is analyzed
irrespective of whether its edges
 have been marked for
removal when considering a prior triplet.
Thus the network constructed by the 
algorithm is independent of the
 order in which the triplets are examined.
Some of the unoriented edges in
$UG$
can be given an orientation
using the same techniques
used to orient edges
in constraint based structure
learning (see Chapter \ref{ch-struc-learn}).



Ref.\cite{aracne} incorrectly claims that
removing the smaller of 3 MI's
is ``an application" of the Data Processing 
Inequality (DPI)
of Shannon Information Theory. 
See Chapter \ref{ch-mchain}
for more info about DPI.
Note that DPI is
only valid for a Markov chain,
and not all
 triplets of random variables
are in a Markov chain.
Removing the smaller of 
3 numbers does not require DPI.

Fig.\ref{fig-aracne}
gives an example 
of the application
of the ARACNE algo.

See Chapter \ref{ch-chow} on 
Chow-Liu trees (CLT).
A CLT is just
a  maximum spanning tree
where the weights are 
mutual informations 
 $MI_{i,j}$
estimated from data.

Sometimes, the outcome
of the ARACNE algo is a CLT.
For example,
Fig.\ref{fig-aracne}
$(a)$
was considered
in Chapter \ref{ch-chow}
on CLTs, and
the CLT algo
also
gave 
Fig.\ref{fig-aracne}
$(c)$ as the final structure.

According to Ref.\cite{aracne}, the 
 ARACNE algo sometimes 
yields  a polytree (i.e., 
a connected graph with no loops).
It may even  
yield a structure with loops.
Hence, it does not always yield a CLT.

By breaking all cliques (i.e., fully
connected subgraphs)
with 3 edges, ARACNE 
breaks all cliques with  
3 or more edges, and therefore
ARACNE yields cliqueless graphs. 
However, cliques are 
not uncommon in Nature,
especially 3 edge cliques. 
Cliques become less likely in Nature 
the bigger the number of edges they have
after 3.
Therefore, a nice  
generalization of ARACNE
would be to start by listing the 
 cliques with the largest possible number
of edges,
and  breaking those by eliminating
their edge with the largest MI.
Then listing the cliques 
with one less edge, and breaking those.
And so on until
we get to the cliques with 3 edges. 
Keep those because they are common in Nature.
Or break them if you want a cliqueless graph
as given by the current ARACNE.
