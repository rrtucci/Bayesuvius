\chapter{Bistability in 2D and 3D systems: COMING SOON}
\label{ch-bistability}

Bistability and hysteresis are common phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems. Below, we'll give examples of systems with 2 or 3 dofs 
(degrees of freedom) with these properties.


\section{Lorenz System}
The  {\bf Lorenz system} arises in fluid mechanics and laser physics, and other places.
It is given by

\beq
\xymatrix{
\rvy\ar[d]\ar[r]\ar@{-->}[drr]
&\bigotimes\ar[drrr]
&\rvx\ar[l]\ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{-->}[dll]
&\bigotimes\ar[dlll]
&\rvz\ar[d]\ar[l]
\\
\dot{\rvy}
&&\dot{\rvx}
&&\dot{\rvz}
}
\eeq

\beq
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\dot{x} = \sigma (y - x)
\\
\dot{y} = x(\rho - z) - y
\\ 
\dot{z} = xy - \beta z
\end{array}
\right.
\eeq

where $\sigma > 0$, $\rho > 0$, and $\beta > 0$ are parameters.

For certain parameter values (e.g., $\sigma = 10, \beta = 8/3, \rho \in [24, 30]$), the Lorenz system exhibits bistability and hysteresis. In this regime, the system has two coexisting attractors (such as chaotic attractors or fixed points) and can jump between them depending on initial conditions and parameter sweeps. This transition can exhibit hysteresis as $\rho$ is increased or decreased.



\section{FitzHugh-Nagumo model}
The {\bf FitzHugh-Nagumo model} is a reduced form of the Hodgkin-Huxley model for neuronal dynamics. It is given by

\beq
\xymatrix{
\rvx^3\ar[dr]
&\rvx\ar[d] \ar[dr]\ar[l]
& \rvy\ar[d]\ar[dl]
\\
1\ar[r]
&\dot{\rvx}
&\dot{\rvy}
}
\eeq

\beq
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\dot{x} = x - \frac{x^3}{3} - y + R
\\
\dot{y} = \frac{1}{\tau} (x - a -b y)
\end{array}
\right.
\eeq




\section{Genetic Toggle Switch}
A  {\bf genetic toggle switch}
can be described by:

\beq
\xymatrix{
\rvx\ar[dr]\ar[d]
&\rvy\ar[dr]\ar[d]
&\rvz\ar[dll]\ar[d]
\\
\dot{\rvx}
&\dot{\rvy}
&\dot{\rvz}
}
\eeq

\beq
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\dot{x} = \frac{\alpha_1}{1 + z^n} - x
\\
 \dot{y} = \frac{\alpha_2}{1 + x^m} - y
 \\ 
 \dot{z} = \frac{\alpha_3}{1 + y^p} - z,
\end{array}
\right.
\eeq

where $x$, $y$, and $z$ represent concentrations of proteins, $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3 > 0$ are production rates, and $n, m, p > 1$ control the steepness of the repression.
