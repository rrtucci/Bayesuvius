\chapter{D-Separation and Do Calculus
Rules for LDEN: COMING SOON}
\label{ch-dsep-lden}
In this chapter,
we will prove the D-Separation Theorem
(see Chapter \ref{ch-dsep}) and
the Do Calculus Rules (see Chapter \ref{ch-do-calc})
for the special bnets that we call
LDEN(see Chapter \ref{ch-linear-sys}). Proving these theorems for LDEN
rather than for general bnets
is much simpler and quite
instructive.
