\label{ci-track}

As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch-counterf},
Judea Pearl has proposed 3 rungs 
of Causal Inference (CI).
This book covers all 3 rungs.
Some people (for instance,
economists)\footnote{This is evinced by
the excellent books Refs.\cite{book-mixtape},
and \cite{alves-book}
written by economists.}
are mostly interested in the highest
2 rungs; i.e, 
rung 2 (do operations)
and rung 3 (imagining/counterfactual thinking).
Here is a subset of chapters
that I call
the CI-2-3 track,
that are devoted mostly to rungs 2 and 3.
