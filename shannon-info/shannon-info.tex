\chapter{Shannon Information Theory}
\label{ch-shannon-info}

Throughout this book, we often use
the definitions of entropy, mutual information,
conditional mutual information, cross entropy, etc.
All these definitions originated from the seminal work
of Claude Shannon. Note that the
connection between bnets and Shannon Information Theory (SIT)
goes much deeper than that.
Most of SIT can be expressed graphically
using bnets, as we explain in Ref.\cite{tucci-shannon-info}.
