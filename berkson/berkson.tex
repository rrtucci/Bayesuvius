Consider the bnet of Fig.\ref{fig-berkson-bnet}.
For that bnet, we have

\beq
P(a,b,x)=P(a)P(b)P(x|a,b)
\;.
\label{eq-berk}
\eeq
Summing Eq.(\ref{eq-berk}) over $x$, we get

\beq
P(a,b)=P(a)P(b)
\eeq
so $\rva$ and $\rvb$ are independent.
It follows that
$a$ can be ignored in calculating
the probability of $b$; i.e.,

\beq
\boxed{
P(b|a)=P(b)}
\;.
\eeq
However,
$a$ cannot be ignored in calculating
the probability of $b$,
if $x$ is being held fixed; i.e., 
 

\beq
\boxed{
P(b|a,x)\neq P(b|x)}
\;.
\eeq
Indeed,

\beq
P(b|a,x)=\frac{P(b)P(x|a,b)}
{\sum_b P(b)P(x|a,b)}
\eeq
whereas

\beq
P(b|x)
=
\frac{\sum_a P(a)P(b)P(x|a,b)}
{\sum_{a,b} P(a)P(b)P(x|a,b)}
\;.
\eeq


Bekson's Paradox is also called  {\bf collider bias} because 
$\rvx$ is a collider.

It's also called {\bf explaining away}
in the special case that
$\rva,\rvb, \rvx\in \{true, false\}$
and $P(x=1|a,b)>0$ for $(a,b)\neq (0,0)$.
In that case, if $\rvx$ is fixed
to true, and the cause
$\rva$ is known to be true, 
then the cause $\rvb$ is
less likely
to be true.
If a crime has been committed  ($\rvx=1$)
and one
of two possible culprits is
proven to be guilty $(\rva=1)$, then
the other culprit $\rvb$ is 
less likely to be guilty
than when the guilt
of $\rva$ was not known; i.e., 
$P(b=1|x=1,a=1)<P(b=1|x=1)$.

Fig.\ref{fig-berkson}
presents an example
of Berkson's paradox. The
figure consists of
a scatter plot
with axes x=intelligence,
y=attractiveness, 
for a population of 
possible dates for a single person. 
For the full population,

\beq
(a,b)\sim P(a,b)=P(a)P(b)
\eeq
whereas for the population
in the white swath,

\beq
(a,b)\sim P(a,b|x)=P(b|a,x)P(a|x)\neq
P(b|x)P(a|x)
\;.
\eeq
