{Bayesian Networks and the 
Passage of Time}

\label{ch-passage-time}

I wrote an article about
this in 2021 for
my blog ``Quantum Bayesian Networks". 
See Ref.\cite{bnets-passage-time}.
For more info
on 2 topics mentioned in the blog post,
see Chapter \ref{ch-granger-c} on 
Granger Causality and Chapter 
\ref{ch-good-causal-fit} on Goodness of Causal Fit.
