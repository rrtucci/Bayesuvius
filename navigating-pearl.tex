\section{Navigating Judea Pearl's Books}
\label{ch-nav-pearl}
Many
of the
greatest ideas 
in the bnet field 
were invented by Judea Pearl
and his collaborators.
Thus, this book is 
heavily indebted to
those great scientists.

Those ideas have had no clearer
and more generous 
expositor than Judea Pearl
himself.

Pearl has 
4 books that I have used
in writing Bayesuvius.

His 
first 1988 book Ref.\cite{pearl-1988book}
was in his pre-causal days.
That book
deals with topics such as
d-separation, belief propagation,
Markov-blankets, and noisy-ors.

The other 
3 books that  came later
are more fully devoted to
causality. They are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
In 2000 (1st ed.), and 2013 (2nd ed.),
Pearl published what
is so far
his most technical
and exhaustive book
on the subject of causality,
Ref\cite{pearl-2013book}.
\item
In 2016,
he released 
together
with Glymour and Jewell,
a less advanced ``primer"
on causality, Ref.\cite{pearl-primer}.
\item
In 2018, 
he released 
together with
Mackenzie his
lovely  ``The Book of Why",
 Ref.\cite{book-why}.
\end{enumerate}
Those 3 books
deal with causality topics
such as do-calculus,
backdoor and front-door
adjustments, 
linear systems with exogenous noise,
and counterfactuals.
