\section{Definition of a Bayesian Network}
\label{ch-bnet-def}

A {\bf directed graph} $G=(V,E)$
consists of two sets, $V$
and $E$. $V$ contains
the {\bf vertices (nodes)}
and $E$ contains the {\bf edges (arrows)}.
An arrow $a\rarrow b$ is an
ordered pair 
$(a,b)$ where $a, b\in V$.
The {\bf parents} 
of a node $x$ are 
those nodes $a$
such that there are arrows 
$a\rarrow x$.
The {\bf children} of a node
$x$
are those nodes $b$
such that there are arrows $x\rarrow b$.
The {\bf neighbors}
of a node $x$
is the set of parents and 
children of $x$.
A {\bf path} is a 
set of nodes that 
are connected 
by arrows, so 
that all nodes
have 1 or 2 neighbors.
A {\bf directed path}
is a path in
which all the arrows point
in the same direction.
A {\bf loop}
is a closed path.
A {\bf cycle} is a directed loop.
A {\bf Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)}
is a directed graph that has no
cycles. 


A {\bf fully connected directed graph}
is 
a directed graph
in which 
every node has all other 
nodes as neighbors.
Figs.\ref{fig-full-conn-4-line}
and
\ref{fig-full-conn-4-square}
show 2 different
ways of drawing
the same directed graph,
a fully connected graph with 4 nodes.
Note that a convenient
way
to label
the nodes of a fully
connected directed
graph
with $N$ nodes
is to point
arrows
from 
$\rvx_j$ to $\rvx_k$
where $j=0, 1, \ldots, N-1$
and 
$k=j+1, j+2, \ldots, N-1$.

A {\bf Bayesian network (bnet)}
consists of a DAG 
and a 
{\bf Transition 
Probability Matrix (TPM)}
associated 
with each node
of the graph.
A TPM is often 
called a {\bf Conditional Probability
Table 
(CPT)}.

In 
this book,
random  variables are
 indicated by 
underlined letters and their values 
by non-underlined letters.
 Each node of a bnet is
 labelled by a random variable.
 Thus, $\rvx=x$ means that node 
$\rvx$ is in state $x$.


\hrule\noindent
{\bf Some sets of nodes 
associated 
with each node $\rva$
of a bnet}
\begin{itemize}
\item
$ch(\rva)=$ children of $\rva$.
\item
$pa(\rva)=$ parents of $\rva$.
\item
$nb(\rva)=pa(\rva)\cup ch(\rva)=$ 
neighbors of $\rva$.
\item
$de(\rva)=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}ch^n(\rva)=$
$ch(\rva)\cup ch\circ ch(\rva)\cup\ldots$, 
descendants of $\rva$. 
\item
$an(\rva)=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}pa^n(\rva)=$
$pa(\rva)\cup pa\circ pa(\rva)\cup\ldots$, 
ancestors of $\rva$.
\end{itemize}
\hrule
In this book,
we will use 
$\rva.$
to indicate
a {\bf multi-node (node set,
node array)} $\rva.=
(\rva_j)_{j=0, 1, \ldots , na-1}$.
We will often
treat multinodes as if
they were sets, and
combine them with
the usual
set
operators.
For instance,
for two
multinodes $\rva.$
and $\rvb.$,
we define
$\rva.\cup\rvb.$,
$\rva.\cap\rvb.$,
$\rva.-\rvb.$
and
$\rva.\subset\rvb.$
in the obvious way.
We 
will indicate
a singleton set (single
node multi-node) $\rva.=\{\rva\}$
simply by $\rva.=\rva$.
For instance,
$\rva.-\rvb=\rva.-\{\rvb\}$.
\hrule

The TPM of a node
$\rvx$ of a bnet
is a matrix of
probabilities 
$P(\rvx=x|pa(\rvx)=a.)$.

A bnet
with nodes $\rvx.$
represents
a probability
distribution

\beq
P(x.)=
\prod_j
P(\rvx_j=x_j|pa(\rvx_j) =pa(x_j))
\;.
\label{eq-chain-rule-bnet}
\eeq

Note that
for a fully connected bnet
with $N$ nodes,
Eq.(\ref{eq-chain-rule-bnet})
becomes

\beq
P(x.)=
\prod_{j=0}^{N-1}
P(x_j| 
(x_k)_{k=j-1, j-2, \ldots, 0})
\;.
\label{eq-chain-rule-cond-probs}
\eeq
For example, if $N=4$,
Eq.(\ref{eq-chain-rule-cond-probs})
 becomes

\beq
P(x_0, x_1,x_2, x_3)=
P(x_3|x_2, x_1, x_0)
P(x_2|x_1, x_0)
P(x_1|x_0)
P(x_0)
\;.
\eeq
We see that 
Eq.(\ref{eq-chain-rule-cond-probs})
is just the chain rule for 
conditional probabilities.
