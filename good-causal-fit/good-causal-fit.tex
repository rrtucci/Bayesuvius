See my paper Ref.\cite{tucci-gcf}
and my software  Ref.\cite{tucci-dag-lie-det}
that implements the theory of the paper.\footnote{Ref.\cite{tucci-gcf} is the GitHub version of the paper. There is also an earlier, less correct, version of the paper in ArXiv.}
 

Here is the abstract of the paper.

\noindent{\bf Abstract}\\
We propose a 
Goodness of Causal Fit (GCF) measure
which depends 
on Judea Pearl's ``do" interventions.
This is different
from Goodness of Fit (GF) measures,
which do not use interventions.
Given a set ${\cal G}$
of DAGs with the same nodes,
to find a good $G\in {\cal G}$,
we propose plotting
$GCF(G)$ versus $GF(G)$
for all $G\in {\cal G}$,
and finding a 
graph $G\in {\cal G}$  with 
a large amount 
of both types of goodness.
We have made 
available at GitHub
an open source Python app that implements
our algorithm for evaluating
$GCF(G)$ for all $G\in\calg$.
