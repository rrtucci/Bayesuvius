\chapter*{Foreword}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}

Welcome to Bayesuvius! a proto-book uploaded to github.

A different Bayesian network is discussed
 in each chapter. Each chapter title is 
the name of a Bnet. Chapter titles are
 in alphabetical order.

This is a volcano in its early stages.
 First version uploaded to a github repo 
called Bayesuvius on June 24, 2020. 
First version only covers 2 Bnets
(Linear Regression and GAN). 
I will add more chapters periodically.
 Remember, this is a moonlighting effort 
so I can't do it all at once.

For any questions about notation, 
please go to Notational Conventions section.

Requests and advice are welcomed.
