The 67 chapters of this book are ordered alphabetically by their title. Each
chapter deals with a different topic from Machine Learning/AI. The topics
covered by this book have been explained before by other authors in their own
books and in the Internet. But, unlike other authors, Tucci tries to explain
everything by using, as far as possible, Bayesian Networks.
 15 of the chapters deal specifically with Causal Inference, using Judea
 Pearl's approach.
